# I will focus on these technologies in 2023

These were chosen via 2 random choice making websites [Textfixer](https://www.textfixer.com/tools/random-choice.php) and [Jklp](http://jklp.org/html/choose.html) \
and these are the results I got. And I will still upload even if it looks like noob code.

## Languages

First I had the choices of picking High or Low level programming languages \
and then I choose 4 different options for languages and since both sites had \
2 different results then I ran the random choice making app again \
and they both resulted in choosing Javascript

## Frameworks

Since Javascript was the winner I also made the decision to \
randomly choose a Framework and the results on both websites is Vue.

    .results{
        display: flex;
        gap: 4rem;
        justify-content: center;
    }
